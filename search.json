I have not spent nearly as much time5 thinking about the processes explored here, as the authors of the original study, nor can I match their expertise on the subject. The motivation behind this is not to question nor affirm the original study. The authors fitted an ecologically motivated model, which they then simplified aiming for parsimony. I am mainly interested in the technicalities of modelling proportions and accounting for phylogenetic relatedness. I will therefore start from the ground up, adding complexity, to see how far I get before I run into trouble. Again, the focus here is on model fitting, not ecology. But I am also, very emphatically, not a statistician. I have tried to explicitly justify every choice I have made and I would like to believe that my choices are sensible. But if you read this and you spot any mistakes, I would be grateful if you point them out to me."

    "text": "baby steps\nif you’d like to play along, the script is available here.\nLet’s start simple, by examining the effect of tree height on root, stem6 and leaf (relative) mass for a single species, Betula alleghaniensis. It’s a good place to start because it is the species with the largest number of individuals in the data (295 trees, unevenly distributed across three locations). Median height is 1.59 m with a range of 0.5-24.42 m. It’s worth keeping in mind that within-species variation in height and biomass allocation does not only depend on ontogeny but also influenced by the environment (e.g. competition with neighbouring trees, climate).\nBefore any model fitting, we are going to standardize our predictor, height; let’s divide the height of each B. alleghaniensis individual by the median height of that species and then take the base 2 logarithm of that quantity. The first of these steps brings individuals of median height at 1. The second step pushes them at 0 (log2(1) = 0) so that the intercepts, the model’s estimates at 0, will be the estimated proportions for a median individual of B. alleghaniensis and now a one-unit change (which is what the coefficient for the predictor corresponds to) amounts to a doubling of height. I’ll do this for all species, not just the focal one.\n\n\nShow the code\nwithin.sp = full_df_mod %&gt;% \n  rename(roots = RmTm,\n         stems = SmTm,\n         leaves = LmTm) %&gt;% \n  # this is how brms expects the response for Dirichlet models \n  mutate(RSL = cbind(roots = .$roots,\n                     stems = .$stems,\n                     leaves = .$leaves)) %&gt;% \n  group_by(SppName) %&gt;% \n  mutate(.after = h.t,\n         ht.median = median(h.t),\n         rel.ht = log2(h.t/ht.median),\n         N = n()) %&gt;% \n  ungroup()\n\n\nNow we will first fit three Beta regression models, each one estimating the effect of relative height on the proportion of an individual’s total biomass that is roots, stems or leaves. We will let the intercept vary by study. Then we will estimate the same relationships but this time, fitting one model for all three proportions7.\n\nlibrary(brms)\nlibrary(tidybayes)\nlibrary(modelr)\n\n# one model for roots\nm.Bet_alle.r &lt;- brm(bf(roots ~ rel.ht + (1|Study)), \n                    data = within.sp %&gt;% \n                      filter(SppName == \"Betula_alleghaniensis\"), \n                    family = Beta(), \n                    chains = 4, \n                    iter = 6000, \n                    warmup = 3000, \n                    cores = 4, \n                    control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99),\n                    backend = \"cmdstanr\",\n                    file = \"fits/m.Bet_alle.r\",\n                    seed = 123)\npp_check(m.Bet_alle.r, ndraws = 200)\n\n# one model for stems\nm.Bet_alle.s &lt;- brm(bf(stems ~ rel.ht + (1|Study)), \n                    data = within.sp %&gt;% \n                      filter(SppName == \"Betula_alleghaniensis\"), \n                    family = Beta(), \n                    chains = 4, \n                    iter = 6000, \n                    warmup = 3000, \n                    cores = 4, \n                    control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99,\n                                   max_treedepth = 12),\n                    backend = \"cmdstanr\",\n                    file = \"fits/m.Bet_alle.s\",\n                    seed = 123)\npp_check(m.Bet_alle.s, ndraws = 200)\n\n# one model for leaves\nm.Bet_alle.l &lt;- brm(bf(leaves ~ rel.ht + (1|Study)), \n                    data = within.sp %&gt;% \n                      filter(SppName == \"Betula_alleghaniensis\"), \n                    family = Beta(), \n                    chains = 4, \n                    iter = 6000, \n                    warmup = 3000, \n                    cores = 4, \n                    control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99,\n                                   max_treedepth = 12),\n                    backend = \"cmdstanr\",\n                    file = \"fits/m.Bet_alle.l\",\n                    seed = 123)\npp_check(m.Bet_alle.l, ndraws = 200)\n\n\n# all in one\nm.Bet_alle.rsl &lt;- brm(bf(RSL ~ rel.ht + (1|Study)), \n                      data = within.sp %&gt;% \n                        filter(SppName == \"Betula_alleghaniensis\"), \n                      family = dirichlet(), \n                      chains = 4, \n                      iter = 9000, \n                      warmup = 3000, \n                      cores = 4, \n                      control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99,\n                                     max_treedepth = 12),\n                      backend = \"cmdstanr\",\n                      file = \"fits/m.Bet_alle.rsl\",\n                      seed = 123)\n# Total execution time: 751.3 seconds.\npp_check(m.Bet_alle.rsl, ndraws = 100)\n# Error: 'pp_check' is not implemented for this family.\n\nFirst sign of “trouble”; we cannot use pp_check() for a Dirichlet regression, to assess how well the model captures the distribution of the data.

To make it easier to see any differences, I have combined the draws from the three Beta models before pushing them through {ggplot}, so that we can have one plot for the three Betas (left) and one for the Dirichlet regression (right):\n\n\nShow the code\nroot = within.sp %&gt;%\n  data_grid(rel.ht = seq_range(rel.ht, n = 51)) %&gt;%\n  add_epred_draws(m.Bet_alle.r, re_formula = NA) %&gt;% \n  add_column(.category = \"roots\")\n\nstem = within.sp %&gt;%\n  data_grid(rel.ht = seq_range(rel.ht, n = 51)) %&gt;%\n  add_epred_draws(m.Bet_alle.s, re_formula = NA) %&gt;% \n  add_column(.category = \"stems\")\n\nleaf = within.sp %&gt;%\n  data_grid(rel.ht = seq_range(rel.ht, n = 51)) %&gt;%\n  add_epred_draws(m.Bet_alle.l, re_formula = NA) %&gt;% \n  add_column(.category = \"leaves\")\n\nrsl = rbind(root,stem,leaf)\nrsl$.category = factor(rsl$.category, levels = c(\"roots\",\"stems\",\"leaves\"))\n\nfig1a = rsl %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = rel.ht, y = .epred, color = .category,\n             fill = .category)) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"grey\") +\n  stat_lineribbon(aes(y = .epred), .width = c(0.9),\n                  point_interval = \"median_qi\",\n                  linewidth = .2)+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(-3,-1,0,1,3), \n                     labels = c(\"1/8\",\"1/2\",1,2,8)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#efd08e\",\"#8d8067\",\"#9dbc9b\")) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#efd08e80\",\"#8d806780\",\"#9dbc9b80\")) +\n  ylab(\"Biomass proportion\") +\n  xlab(\"multiplicative change in relative height\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Predictions of three Beta regressions\")\n\nfig1b = within.sp %&gt;%\n  data_grid(rel.ht = seq_range(rel.ht, n = 51)) %&gt;%\n  add_epred_draws(m.Bet_alle.rsl, re_formula = NA) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = rel.ht, y = .epred, color = .category,\n             fill = .category)) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"grey\") +\n  stat_lineribbon(aes(y = .epred), .width = c(0.9),\n                  point_interval = \"median_qi\",\n                  linewidth = .2)+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(-3,-1,0,1,3), \n                     labels = c(\"1/8\",\"1/2\",1,2,8)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#efd08e\",\"#8d8067\",\"#9dbc9b\")) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#efd08e80\",\"#8d806780\",\"#9dbc9b80\")) +\n  ylab(\"Biomass proportion\") +\n  xlab(\"multiplicative change in relative height\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.title = element_blank()) + \n  ggtitle(\"Predictions of Dirichlet regression\")\n\nlibrary(patchwork)\nfig1 = fig1a+fig1b\n\nggsave(\"figs/fig1.png\", fig1, units = \"mm\",\n       width = 180,\n       height = 75,\n       scale = 1.4)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Model estimates with the two different approaches. Thin lines are the median estimates, bound by 90% credible envelopes.\n\n\nThey are not alarmingly different but you can see the wider uncertainty for the stem proportion across the height gradient and the change in the shape of the root-height relationship. The big picture is the same though and at this point, while we are only looking at one species and not yet asking how leaf habit or mycorrhizal association can modify this relationship, these differences are inconsequential.\nSo taller trees allocate increasingly more biomass to stems, relative to roots or leaves. An individual of median height is already around 50% stem, while leaves are the smallest proportion. (Probably not news to anyone studying tree allometry; I wouldn’t know)."

This means that when we are partially pooling information across species, the extent of pooling depends on how closely related the different species are. You can read more about phylogenetic multilevel models with {brms} here. Getting the data set-up right was a process of trial and error, but {brms} throws fairly informative errors. We need:\n\na phylogenetic tree (provided by Jevon and Lang (2022)) to construct the variance-covariance matrix,\na grouping variable (phylo) telling us which node of the tree each observation belongs to, but this needs to be distinct from our species variable (SppName) even though they (must) contain the same information,\nthe names of the vcv matrix need to match the elements of phylo.\n\nNote that we are dealing with a phylogenetic model with repeated measurements within each node/species which is why we need to go through the SppName-phylo matching shenanigans. We’ve also had not just the intercept but also the effect of height on biomass allocation be constrained by phylogeny.

As far as I can tell, it is not possible to use {marginaleffects} or {emmeans} to calculate contrasts, for example. But these can be calculated manually from the posterior draws (left as an exercise for the reader 😉).\nThe phylogenetic model is simple enough to specify but can be computationally prohibitive depending on your processor and RAM.\nTrees are interesting 🤔."

    "text": "I recently defended my PhD thesis. In February 2025 I will join Anne McLeod’s Computational Ecology group in IGB Berlin as a postdoc.\nThe last four and a half years, I did research in the context of the Jena Experiment, a longterm grassland biodiversity and ecosystem functioning field experiment, located outside of Jena in Thuringia, Germany. In that phase of the experiment, we were interested in understanding why the positive effect of plant diversity on ecosystem functions — such as productivity — apparently strengthens over time. My project focused on the belowground component of the ecosystem. We examined the effects of plant diversity on functions performed by the multi-trophic community of soil fauna, in old and new communities. This work combined a field experiment, a mesocosm experiment and a bit of modelling.\nMy experiences and readings during this time have shifted my attention towards diversity and functioning relationships at larger spatial scales and under changing environmental conditions. So, to the links that represent trophic relationships between different populations in a community, I am now adding the links that represent interconnected communities in a landscape. Networks everywhere.\n\n\n\nIt’s all connected.\n\n\nI am also increasingly enthusiastic about Bayesian statistics and Agent Based Modelling. For the first, after joining Richard McElreath’s course a couple of years ago, I am teaching myself Stan (although for my work, my needs are usually covered by {brms}). For the second, I am slowly working my way through Paul Smaldino’s Modeling social behavior: Mathematical and agent-based models of social dynamics and cultural evolution, solving the exercises in NetLogo and sometimes trying to do the same using Agents.jl. Why would an ecologist choose a social science textbook to learn ABMs? I like the way he thinks and writes about modelling.\nWhen I am not sciencing, I read novels, listen to noisy music, watch old films or wander about in nature. In order of decreasing frequency."
