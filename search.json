I have not spent nearly as much time5 thinking about the processes explored here, as the authors of the original study, nor can I match their expertise on the subject. The motivation behind this is not to question nor affirm the original study. The authors fitted an ecologically motivated model, which they then simplified aiming for parsimony. I am mainly interested in the technicalities of modelling proportions and accounting for phylogenetic relatedness. I will therefore start from the ground up, adding complexity, to see how far I get before I run into trouble. Again, the focus here is on model fitting, not ecology. But I am also, very emphatically, not a statistician. I have tried to explicitly justify every choice I have made and I would like to believe that my choices are sensible. But if you read this and you spot any mistakes, I would be grateful if you point them out to me."

    "text": "baby steps\nif you’d like to play along, the script is available here.\nLet’s start simple, by examining the effect of tree height on root, stem6 and leaf (relative) mass for a single species, Betula alleghaniensis. It’s a good place to start because it is the species with the largest number of individuals in the data (295 trees, unevenly distributed across three locations). Median height is 1.59 m with a range of 0.5-24.42 m. It’s worth keeping in mind that within-species variation in height and biomass allocation does not only depend on ontogeny but also influenced by the environment (e.g. competition with neighbouring trees, climate).\nBefore any model fitting, we are going to standardize our predictor, height; let’s divide the height of each B. alleghaniensis individual by the median height of that species and then take the base 2 logarithm of that quantity. The first of these steps brings individuals of median height at 1. The second step pushes them at 0 (log2(1) = 0) so that the intercepts, the model’s estimates at 0, will be the estimated proportions for a median individual of B. alleghaniensis and now a one-unit change (which is what the coefficient for the predictor corresponds to) amounts to a doubling of height. I’ll do this for all species, not just the focal one.\n\n\nShow the code\nwithin.sp = full_df_mod %&gt;% \n  rename(roots = RmTm,\n         stems = SmTm,\n         leaves = LmTm) %&gt;% \n  # this is how brms expects the response for Dirichlet models \n  mutate(RSL = cbind(roots = .$roots,\n                     stems = .$stems,\n                     leaves = .$leaves)) %&gt;% \n  group_by(SppName) %&gt;% \n  mutate(.after = h.t,\n         ht.median = median(h.t),\n         rel.ht = log2(h.t/ht.median),\n         N = n()) %&gt;% \n  ungroup()\n\n\nNow we will first fit three Beta regression models, each one estimating the effect of relative height on the proportion of an individual’s total biomass that is roots, stems or leaves. We will let the intercept vary by study. Then we will estimate the same relationships but this time, fitting one model for all three proportions7.\n\nlibrary(brms)\nlibrary(tidybayes)\nlibrary(modelr)\n\n# one model for roots\nm.Bet_alle.r &lt;- brm(bf(roots ~ rel.ht + (1|Study)), \n                    data = within.sp %&gt;% \n                      filter(SppName == \"Betula_alleghaniensis\"), \n                    family = Beta(), \n                    chains = 4, \n                    iter = 6000, \n                    warmup = 3000, \n                    cores = 4, \n                    control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99),\n                    backend = \"cmdstanr\",\n                    file = \"fits/m.Bet_alle.r\",\n                    seed = 123)\npp_check(m.Bet_alle.r, ndraws = 200)\n\n# one model for stems\nm.Bet_alle.s &lt;- brm(bf(stems ~ rel.ht + (1|Study)), \n                    data = within.sp %&gt;% \n                      filter(SppName == \"Betula_alleghaniensis\"), \n                    family = Beta(), \n                    chains = 4, \n                    iter = 6000, \n                    warmup = 3000, \n                    cores = 4, \n                    control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99,\n                                   max_treedepth = 12),\n                    backend = \"cmdstanr\",\n                    file = \"fits/m.Bet_alle.s\",\n                    seed = 123)\npp_check(m.Bet_alle.s, ndraws = 200)\n\n# one model for leaves\nm.Bet_alle.l &lt;- brm(bf(leaves ~ rel.ht + (1|Study)), \n                    data = within.sp %&gt;% \n                      filter(SppName == \"Betula_alleghaniensis\"), \n                    family = Beta(), \n                    chains = 4, \n                    iter = 6000, \n                    warmup = 3000, \n                    cores = 4, \n                    control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99,\n                                   max_treedepth = 12),\n                    backend = \"cmdstanr\",\n                    file = \"fits/m.Bet_alle.l\",\n                    seed = 123)\npp_check(m.Bet_alle.l, ndraws = 200)\n\n\n# all in one\nm.Bet_alle.rsl &lt;- brm(bf(RSL ~ rel.ht + (1|Study)), \n                      data = within.sp %&gt;% \n                        filter(SppName == \"Betula_alleghaniensis\"), \n                      family = dirichlet(), \n                      chains = 4, \n                      iter = 9000, \n                      warmup = 3000, \n                      cores = 4, \n                      control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99,\n                                     max_treedepth = 12),\n                      backend = \"cmdstanr\",\n                      file = \"fits/m.Bet_alle.rsl\",\n                      seed = 123)\n# Total execution time: 751.3 seconds.\npp_check(m.Bet_alle.rsl, ndraws = 100)\n# Error: 'pp_check' is not implemented for this family.\n\nFirst sign of “trouble”; we cannot use pp_check() for a Dirichlet regression, to assess how well the model captures the distribution of the data.

To make it easier to see any differences, I have combined the draws from the three Beta models before pushing them through {ggplot}, so that we can have one plot for the three Betas (left) and one for the Dirichlet regression (right):\n\n\nShow the code\nroot = within.sp %&gt;%\n  data_grid(rel.ht = seq_range(rel.ht, n = 51)) %&gt;%\n  add_epred_draws(m.Bet_alle.r, re_formula = NA) %&gt;% \n  add_column(.category = \"roots\")\n\nstem = within.sp %&gt;%\n  data_grid(rel.ht = seq_range(rel.ht, n = 51)) %&gt;%\n  add_epred_draws(m.Bet_alle.s, re_formula = NA) %&gt;% \n  add_column(.category = \"stems\")\n\nleaf = within.sp %&gt;%\n  data_grid(rel.ht = seq_range(rel.ht, n = 51)) %&gt;%\n  add_epred_draws(m.Bet_alle.l, re_formula = NA) %&gt;% \n  add_column(.category = \"leaves\")\n\nrsl = rbind(root,stem,leaf)\nrsl$.category = factor(rsl$.category, levels = c(\"roots\",\"stems\",\"leaves\"))\n\nfig1a = rsl %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = rel.ht, y = .epred, color = .category,\n             fill = .category)) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"grey\") +\n  stat_lineribbon(aes(y = .epred), .width = c(0.9),\n                  point_interval = \"median_qi\",\n                  linewidth = .2)+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(-3,-1,0,1,3), \n                     labels = c(\"1/8\",\"1/2\",1,2,8)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#efd08e\",\"#8d8067\",\"#9dbc9b\")) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#efd08e80\",\"#8d806780\",\"#9dbc9b80\")) +\n  ylab(\"Biomass proportion\") +\n  xlab(\"multiplicative change in relative height\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Predictions of three Beta regressions\")\n\nfig1b = within.sp %&gt;%\n  data_grid(rel.ht = seq_range(rel.ht, n = 51)) %&gt;%\n  add_epred_draws(m.Bet_alle.rsl, re_formula = NA) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = rel.ht, y = .epred, color = .category,\n             fill = .category)) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"grey\") +\n  stat_lineribbon(aes(y = .epred), .width = c(0.9),\n                  point_interval = \"median_qi\",\n                  linewidth = .2)+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(-3,-1,0,1,3), \n                     labels = c(\"1/8\",\"1/2\",1,2,8)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#efd08e\",\"#8d8067\",\"#9dbc9b\")) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#efd08e80\",\"#8d806780\",\"#9dbc9b80\")) +\n  ylab(\"Biomass proportion\") +\n  xlab(\"multiplicative change in relative height\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.title = element_blank()) + \n  ggtitle(\"Predictions of Dirichlet regression\")\n\nlibrary(patchwork)\nfig1 = fig1a+fig1b\n\nggsave(\"figs/fig1.png\", fig1, units = \"mm\",\n       width = 180,\n       height = 75,\n       scale = 1.4)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Model estimates with the two different approaches. Thin lines are the median estimates, bound by 90% credible envelopes.\n\n\nThey are not alarmingly different but you can see the wider uncertainty for the stem proportion across the height gradient and the change in the shape of the root-height relationship. The big picture is the same though and at this point, while we are only looking at one species and not yet asking how leaf habit or mycorrhizal association can modify this relationship, these differences are inconsequential.\nSo taller trees allocate increasingly more biomass to stems, relative to roots or leaves. An individual of median height is already around 50% stem, while leaves are the smallest proportion. (Probably not news to anyone studying tree allometry; I wouldn’t know)."

This sounds like a case for crossed random effects; we will account for the clustering of observations within species and within studies.

In that phase of the experiment, we were interested in understanding why the positive effect of plant diversity on ecosystem functions — such as productivity — apparently strengthens over time. My project focused on the belowground component of the ecosystem. We examined the effects of plant diversity on functions performed by the multi-trophic community of soil fauna, in old and new communities. This work combined a field experiment, a mesocosm experiment and a bit of modelling.\nMy experiences and readings during this time have shifted my attention towards diversity and functioning relationships at larger spatial scales and under changing environmental conditions. So, to the links that represent trophic relationships between different populations in a community, I am now adding the links that represent interconnected communities in a landscape. Networks everywhere.\n\n\n\nIt’s all connected.\n\n\nI am also increasingly enthusiastic about Bayesian statistics and Agent Based Modelling.

For the second, I am slowly working my way through Paul Smaldino’s Modeling social behavior: Mathematical and agent-based models of social dynamics and cultural evolution, solving the exercises in NetLogo and sometimes trying to do the same using Agents.jl.

It assumes that the dependent variable itself, conditional on the predictor, is normally distributed. Where did the error go? Its presence in this formulation is implicit; a consequence of modeling the dependent as a random variable, rather than attributing variability to an explicit error term. In the case of a linear model, the choice between the two formulations is purely a philosophical matter.\nThe limitation of the first, error-centric formulation is that it does not work for any distribution except one, albeit the one we use most of the time.\nThe second formulation generalizes to any distribution you can think of. Here it is for Poisson: \\[\ny_i  \\sim Poisson(\\mu_i) \\\\\n\\] \\[\n\\mu_i = e^{\\alpha + \\beta \\cdot x_i} \\\\\n\\] \\[\nor \\\\\n\\] \\[\nlog(\\mu_i) = \\alpha + \\beta \\cdot x_i\n\\]\nHere it is again, for Beta: \\[\ny_i  \\sim Beta(\\mu_i\\cdot\\phi, (1 - \\mu_i)\\cdot\\phi) \\\\\n\\] \\[\nlogit(\\mu_i) = \\alpha + \\beta \\cdot x_i \\\\\n\\]\nIn the case of GLMs, it is not really useful to talk about an error distribution2.\nThere are two possible interpretations of the phrase “Poisson distributed errors”. The most straightforward one is that the authors actually mean that they assume the errors to be Poisson distributed, which does not make a lot of sense. It implies an additive error term, similar to that in the very first equation we started from but drawn instead from a Poisson distribution. A more between-the-lines interpretation is that the phrase is shorthand for”we assume the errors to be those of a Poisson distributed variable”. It is a creative and generous interpretation.\nBut I think it is futile to ponder what the authors really mean when they write such a phrase. There is no active thought process involved here; this is just boilerplate. For a lot of people, this is the most boring section of a paper to write. They just write whatever one typically writes there, mutatis mutandis, and move to the juicy stuff. So, as we collectively graduated from good old Ordinary Least Squares linear regression—with a normal distribution for the errors or the dependent variable, as you like it—to GLMs, we took the “normally distributed errors” phrase and mutated it by just swapping out the distribution. That doesn’t quite do the job unfortunately. Yes, when we read that, we understand what you did with your model. But you’re saying something different from what you actually did."

    "section": "",
    "text": "note\n\n\n\nThis was originally a short detour in something longer I am working on. I decided to turn it into a standalone short explainer I can point to.\nOne of the metrics that we use to quantify the diversity of an ecological community is Shannon’s entropy. In contrast to “richness”, i.e. the number of species that comprise the community, entropy is determined not only by how many species are there but also their relative abundance. It is calculated as\n\\[\nH' = -\\sum_i p_i log(p_i)\n\\]\nwhere \\(p_i\\) is the relative abundance of species \\(i\\)1. So, if we have an “even” community of four species [🦑, 🐟, 🦀, 🐚] equally abundant, its entropy is:\n-((1/4)*log(1/4))*4\n\n[1] 1.386294\nThere are two ways for entropy to go down. If all 🦑 individuals suddenly vanished2, the new entropy would be:\n-((1/3)*log(1/3))*3\n\n[1] 1.098612\nThe other way for entropy to drop is if the community became less even, changing for example from \\([.25, .25, .25, .25]\\) to \\([.4, .2, .2, .2]\\). Here’s the new entropy:\n-((.4)*log(.4)) - ((.2)*log(.2))*3\n\n[1] 1.332179\nThe number of species determines an upper limit to diversity; how uneven a community is determines how far below that the actual diversity is. The exponent of entropy is sometimes called the effective number of species (for entropy). What does that mean? If we exponentiate the entropy of the initial four-species even community, we get back 4, the number of species. If we exponentiate the uneven community, we get back 3.79. This way, we match our uneven community to an even community of 3.79 species. An even community of 3.79 species has the same entropy as our uneven community, 1.33. So, weird as it may sound, we use \\(species\\) as a continuous unit of measurement to measure diversity in a way that, in fact, incorporates information about both the number of species and the community’s evenness.\n# the entropy of an even 4-species community\n-((1/4)*log(1/4))*4\n\n[1] 1.386294\n\n# the exponent of the entropy of an even 4-species community\nexp(-((1/4)*log(1/4))*4)\n\n[1] 4\n\n# the entropy of an uneven 4-species community with [.4, .2, .2, .2]\n-((.4)*log(.4)) - ((.2)*log(.2))*3\n\n[1] 1.332179\n\n# the exponent of the entropy of an uneven 4-species community with [.4, .2, .2, .2]\nexp(-((.4)*log(.4)) - ((.2)*log(.2))*3)\n\n[1] 3.789291\n\n# the entropy of an even community of 3.79 species\n-((1/3.789291)*log(1/3.789291))*3.789291\n\n[1] 1.332179\nYou can see this from the perspective of a generalist consumer that feeds indiscriminately on these four species. In an environment where the four prey species are equally “available”, the consumer’s diet will consist of four species. In an environment where 97% of prey individuals belong to one species, with the other three species taking up 1% each, the effective number of prey species will be 1.18. The effective diversity of the consumer’s diet is slightly above one species.\nexp(-((.97)*log(.97)) - ((.01)*log(.01))*3)\n\n[1] 1.182582\nWorking with the effective number of species (for Shannon’s entropy), we can examine changes in diversity across an additive scale of even communities. Working with entropy, the natural logarithm of the effective number of species, we examine these changes in a multiplicative scale. One unit change is \\(e\\) times up or down in diversity.\nWell, this is because we have been calculating entropy using the natural logarithm. However, there is no particular reason to use the natural logarithm. Switching to base 2 would make things a bit more intuitive, I think3. When it comes to changes in magnitude, whether it’s time, distance or size, half of something or double of something is more graspable than \\(e\\) times of the thing, right? I would argue that half/double is also more graspable than ten times something or one tenth of the thing4. It’s good to make things as graspable as we can. In fact, one argument in favor of using the effective number of species instead of raw Shannon entropies when communicating changes in diversity, is that we might misrepresent the magnitude of change. I am not sure this is a real issue, as long as we keep in mind that we are dealing with multiplicative changes5. And especially if we work with base 2 logarithms to calculate Shannon entropy, things are fairly straightforward: one unit of change in entropy represents a doubling (or halving) of diversity in terms of the effective number of species."
